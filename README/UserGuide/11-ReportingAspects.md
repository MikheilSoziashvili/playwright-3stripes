# 11. Reporting Aspects - Playwright Seed

This seed provided the following reporting options:

- Playwright HTML Report
- Allure Report
- Test Reporting Portal
- Junit Report (which is utilised for XRAY integrations)

Please refer to the configuration file for the default configuration file - [playwright.config.js](../../playwright.config.js) and [08-ExecuteFromJenkins.md](08-ExecuteFromJenkins.md) for Jenkins integrations for the above reports.

Additional configurations can also be added at a test level to pass test artifacts. As a standardised solution these are out of scope of the seed, but you may reach out to us on [SUPPORT_TESTING](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a9887ce8b989549f7ba468c80885926da%40thread.tacv2/SUPPORT_TESTING?groupId=9ebcbabe-a60f-4b1f-bf48-a51d799159f0&tenantId=3bfeb222-e42c-4535-aace-ea6f7751369b) for any concerns.
